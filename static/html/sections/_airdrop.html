        <h1>CORI - Airdrop</h1>
        <p>Corrently is an entirely <a href="https://corrently.de/">new product in the electricity market</a>. Our approach is to accelerate the expansion of renewable energy generation by giving each electricity customer the possibility to do micro-investments. Instead depending on governmental funds each owner of renewable energy generation facilities can offer their wind-mill, PV-panel or water turbine to be tokenized by STROMDAO.</p>
        <p>Primary purpose of <a href="https://corrently.com/">Corrently Invest Token (CORI)</a> is a profit distribution coming out of those micro investments. CORI shareholders get their energy bills deducted by the shared profit automatically. Shareholders without an electricity tariff receive dividends by requesting a withdraw via a smart-comtract.</p>
        <h2>Get 0.01 CORI to your Wallet</h2>
        <p>We believe in transparency and think it should start with an <a href="./ledger_cori.html">public visible accounting</a>.
          Most crypto/blockchain startups we have seen, lack a possibility to pay dividends.
          Therefore Thorsten published a <a href="https://medium.com/@zoernert/dividend-profit-payouts-for-icos-and-other-share-holder-societies-6bdbfdcb32f9">Medium article</a> that describes how we do profit
          distribution in Ethereum's smart contracts.
