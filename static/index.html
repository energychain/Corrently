              <p><a href="https://stromdao.de/"><strong>STROM</strong>DAO</a> developed an electricity tariff with a loyalty program allowing every electricity customer to do micro investments into renewable energy generation facilities (REGF). Primary purpose of Corrently Invest Token (CORI) is a profit distribution coming out of those micro investments. CORI shareholders get their energy bills deducted by the shared profit automatically. Shareholders without an electricity tariff could request a fiat currency payout monthly by filing an invoice to <strong>STROM</strong>DAO not later than 60 days after end of month (disagio, tax and handling apply).</p>
              <p>Each Corrently represents one kilowatt-hour of consumed electricity. As consumption behaviors differ the amount of Corrently´s collected during a month is different as well. A single-family household with 3 persons for example might consume around 200 kWh of electricity and therefore collect 200 corrently´s per month. These Corrently´s can then be spent to purchase CORI Invest Tokens which in turn grants a shared profit of the REGF´s profit. The micro investment mechanism works directly off the customers electricity bill. The CORI Tokens are native assets backed tokens which are based on the ERC 20 Token Standard. That means that they are compatible with the Ethereum Blockchain. However, as the public Ethereum Blockchain is not yet suited to handle small scale and high-volume energy transactions <strong>STROM</strong>DAO developed the Fury Network – an open-source, Ethereum based blockchain specially designed for energy market needs. </p>
              <p>In contrast to platform approaches (e.g. putting a wind-mill on a platform and granting the members of the platform a share of the wind-mills profits) <strong>STROM</strong>DAO does not act as a man in the middle. Yes, the REGF´s are selected by us and yes we decide the amount of CORI tokens which are equivalent to the REGF´s value. But once you buy CORI´s you are the owner. So, we cannot revoke your access, your ownership and therefore your profit claim. We are no middle man because blockchain technology enables you to create your own energy generation portfolio.</p>
            <p>And that is the reason why we established Corrently. We believe in the potential of micro-investments for renewable energy, and that through its application, customers may find an easy and efficient way of to contribute into a sustainable power supply. </p>
              <p>Our vision at <strong>STROM</strong>DAO is to allow asset owners to fund their activities as simply and securely as possible by utilizing digital currencies for project development. While at the same time enable electricity customers to gradually become energy prosumers simply by paying their bill and returning their Corrently´s into CORI Tokens.</p>
              <p>Overall Corrently is way more than just a new electricity tariff with a fancy bonus system.</p>
              <p> The aim of Corrently is non less than:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Create a simple and meaningful way of electricity customers to build their own portfolio of renewable energy generating facilities</li>
                <li>Offer owners of such facilities a possibility to capitalize on their assets in a sustainable way instead of selling their electricity to “the market” for low prices. </li>
                <li>Build a community of CORI Token-owners which can trade their Tokens e.g. with neighbors and therefore essentially create a decentralized market for sustainable energy micro-investments with no entry barriers. </li>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Corrently is an entirely new product in the electricity market. Our approach is to accelerate the expansion of renewable energy generation by giving each electricity customer the possibility to do micro-investments. Instead depending on governmental funds each owner of renewable energy generation facilities can offer their wind-mill, PV-panel or water turbine to be tokenized by STROMDAO. The working mechanism is displayed in the following figure.</p>
            <img src="./img/cori_process.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Capacity Sharing with Corrently/CORI"/>
            <div class="spacer" style="height:25px"></div>
            <p>In a first step electricity customers pay their monthly electricity bills as usual.
              For each Kilowatt hour of electricity one Corrently will be issued to their account.
              Each customer can now decided what to do with his or her amount of Corrently´s.
              One option is to exchange Corrently´s for CORI Tokens by using the STROMDAO Marketplace (step 2).
              Within the <a href="https://corrently.de/portal/index.html">online-marketplace</a> customers can select renewable energy generation facilities they would like to invest their Corrently´s into.
              In addition to exchanging Corrently´s for CORI´s one might also chose to support one of a variety of <a href="https://corrently.de/portal/getbonus.html">social projects</a> .
              <p>CORI Tokens represent a share of an energy generation portfolio (step 3). Each renewable energy generation facility has a defined amount of CORI´s that are eligible to be sold.
              The amount is put into the balance sheet of a smart contract which in deployed on the Ethereum based Blockchain designed by STROMDAO (<a href="https://fury.network/">Fury Network</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              So what each customer is actually doing when purchasing CORI´s Tokens in exchange for Corrently Bonus points is to trigger this smart contract (address is public)
              and make a transfer of CORI Tokens from the smart contract address to one’s own electricity account.
              This electricity account in turn is represented by an address within the Fury Network.</p>
            <p>The purchase of CORI`s therefore is an actual transfer of ownership of an asset which is the digital
              twin of the renewable energy generation facility! Each customer can now precisely track.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>the amount of Kilowatt-hours produced by his energy portfolio</li>
                <li>the degree of his or her energy self-sufficiency (share of electricity from the energy portfolio  and the public grid)</li>
                <li>the amount of shares of his or her own energy generating facility</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Over time the degree of energy self-sufficiency will raise as a higher share of electricity will directly be generated by ones energy portfolio.
                Therefore electricity needed from the utilities will drop. In the long term electricity will not only get cheaper but also more sustainable.
                Each customer and CORI owner can decide which energy portfolio fits his/ her needs best.
                The mix of wind-mills, pv-panel, storage and water-mill shares is completely up to the customer!</p>
              <p>In addition to an increased energy self-sufficiency the induvial energy portfolio is generating profit which is paid to CORI Token holders according to their amount (step 4.1 in figure 1).</p>

            <h1>Company Structure</h1>
            <p>
              Since its beginning as an open-source project for building an Ethereum based Blockchain for
              energy market transactions back in 2015 it has been the mission of STROMDAO to enable people to actively shape the future of renewable energies in Germany.
              As every success story starts with the team building it our core team will be introduced in this chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>“If everyone is moving forward, then success takes care of itself” (Henry Ford)</em>
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
            In 2015 the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy was in search for a new energy market design. As decentralization of energy production and digitization of communication between energy market actors became widespread new concepts were demanded. . The aim of the legislative process was to develop an electricity market design for the energy transition, as the existing model became inefficient as the share of electricity generated from renewable sources increased.
            </p>
            <p>Thorsten Zoerner (founder and creator of STROMDAO) developed the model of the hybrid electricity market and submitted it to the Ministry. At the same time, a white paper was published and made known to the industry.</p>
            <p>The 2015 amendment partially complied with the proposed market model and its rules, paving the way for the commercial implementation of the mechanisms described.</p>
            <p>It quickly became apparent that the processes for billing and business processing established in the energy industry were standardized, but were not able to ensure a small-scale implementation. What was needed was a technology that made it possible to express ownership of small shares and to document the transfer without gaps.</p>
            <p>In 2016, Stefan Thon and Thorsten Zoerner met in a project to develop a standard for the settlement of so-called "residential electricity".  It turned out that the task contained the same problems that were solved with the hybrid power market model. An additional difficulty, however, was that a solution was sought that was able to represent the market rules automatically on a decentralized basis (in the object). The blockchain technology was used, which solved the problem of consensus building of all parties (=tenant, plant operator, owner) also in the absence of a central control.</p>
            <p>Energy economist Manuel Utz joined the team in spring 2017. The first electricity customers were supplied with it and the first prototype of a hybrid electricity tariff was developed.</p>
            <p>Corrently is the logical and consistent further development of the first hybrid electricity tariff developed back in 2017.
            </p>
            <h2>Team</h2>
            <img src="./img/stromdao_team.png" class="img-fluid"/>
            <p>The founding team of STROMDAO consists of Thorsten, Stefan and Manuel. Due to family reasons Stefan decided to leave STROMDAO by the middle of 2018.</p>
            <h3>Thorsten Zoerner (Managing director)</h3>
            <p>Since 2007 I have been working on the electricity grid and the electricity market. At the same time, a blog was created to provide information on the respective topics. It can be found at blog.stromhaltig.de.</p>
            <p>So far I have published three books on the energy industry. In my book on the hybrid electricity market, published in 2014, I describe a market design that was included in the Electricity Market 2.0 legislative package in Germany. This combines two technologies of electricity procurement: the house connection with purchase from a classic electricity supplier and an alternative purchase of renewable energies. The economic advantages of such a market design have been proven.</p>
            <p>Digitalization will also influence tomorrow's energy industry. Therefore I have intensively dealt with the topic of blockchain technology. Blockchain is a technology that can simplify the exchange and documentation of data. Therefore, this technology can revolutionize today's energy system with the help of digital possibilities. This enables automatic balancing of energy generation and energy consumption.</p>

            <h3>Manuel Utz (Partner)</h3>
            <p>The topic of industrial energy management has been my hobbyhorse since I studied industrial engineering. In the course of my employment as energy manager at the medical technology company Fresenius after my studies, the core questions revolved around increasing energy efficiency by creating data transparency. And here established software tools quickly reached their limits. In contrast to production processes which are carried out and monitored with a high degree of automation, the precise monitoring of energy quantities is still a great challenge. The fact that the topic of energy management goes far beyond efficiency increases and often completely new business models become possible is hardly lived in the industrial environment.</p>
            <p>Against this background - to make energy flows more transparent and to develop new business models for energy-intensive companies - I became a shareholder of StromDAO UG in spring 2017. Here we have already implemented numerous projects as described above - and with the hybrid power product a real bang in the energy industry is imminent.</p>
            <p>The technical implementation of the product is decisively connected with the blockchain technology. A technology which is already in practical use and on the basis of which many business models, especially in the energy industry, are possible. This is one reason why I am working on this topic in my parallel doctorate.</p>

            <h2>Redemption and profit sharing policy</h2>
            <p>Shareholders within a valid <strong>STROM</strong>DAO tariff receive shared profit automatically (aprox. 2000 Tokens required for a monthly reduction of 1€, based on actually generation in payment cycle).</p>
            <p>All token holders have the freedom to share, trade, sell and buy <strong>Corrently Invest Tokens (CORI)</strong> at any time.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Customers could reduce their bills further by buying additional tokens from the market.</li>
              <li>Operators/physical asset owners (party that shares profit) could buy back obligations they sold.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Clearing is done monthly within the consens of a single block in Ethereum public blockchain (aka: <a href="http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/">Homestead</a>). <strong>STROM</strong>DAO is entitled by its customers (electricity consumers) to collect debits from property owners and deduct customer electricity bills.</p>

            <h2>Dividend Payouts</h2>
            <p>Profit from assets is shared with token holders. While <strong>STROM</strong>DAO services
need to have certain centralized elements for its energy market services, we strive towards
decentralization and the minimization of trust related issues.</p>
<p>All asset income for the CORI token is publicly reported and visible on its payout smart contract.
To verify the integrity of  data, users will be able to check entitled dividends
on this website. </p>
<p>Based on these monthly results, <strong>STROM</strong>DAO loads the ETH (Ethereum) amount of dividend
payouts onto a smart contract. The smart contract will contain a table of dividend
distributions. Think of it as a snapshot taken when dividends have been declared. Token
holders will then proceed to query the smart contract dividend distribution function to
move dividends from the wallet in which the tokens were stored at the time the
“snapshot” was taken. The smart contract will proceed to pay out dividends to the wallet
that made the request after validating all provided information. If the “snapshots” do not
match the dividend payout amounts at 100% validity, the smart contract will refuse the
payout request. This means that either all dividends will be paid out fairly and accurately
or no dividends will be released at all.</p>
<p>
The team of <strong>STROM</strong>DAO monitors real-time dividend payouts as micro transactions. However, the Ethereum network’s
capabilities do not currently extend to high-volume transactions of such small size.
For optimization tariff customers receive payouts from within a single, aggregated transaction.
</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                  <li>No action required if you have a electricity tariff from <strong>STROM</strong>. Customers receive dividends directly with their monthly bills.</li>
                  <li>Shareholders from outside of Germany might file an invoice to <strong>STROM</strong>DAO (disagio, tax and service fees apply)</li>
